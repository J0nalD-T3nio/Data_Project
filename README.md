# This is My First Project in Data Engineering

# End-to-End Data Project

This repository showcases an end-to-end data project that demonstrates a developer's journey into the field of data. It covers tasks undertaken by data engineers, data scientists, and data engineers, utilizing various technologies and programming languages.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Extraction**: Python scripts are used to extract CSV files from an FTP server.

2. **Data Loading**: Visual Studio SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) is employed to load the extracted files from the FTP server into a PostgreSQL database.

3. **API Development**: A screening API is created using the FastAPI framework, providing an interface for accessing and interacting with the data.

4. **Data Visualization and Modeling**: Power BI is utilized for data visualization and modeling, enabling insightful analysis of the data loaded into the PostgreSQL database.

5. **Supervised Machine Learning and Regression Analysis**: R programming language, along with the Tidyverse package set, is used for creating a supervised machine learning and regression analysis primer, exploring predictive modeling techniques.

6. **Machine Learning Pipeline**: A machine learning pipeline is developed using Python's scikit-learn library, facilitating end-to-end data processing, model training, and evaluation.
